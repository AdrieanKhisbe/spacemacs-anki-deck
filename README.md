To Generate the `apkg` deck you can either:
- install `spacemacs-anki-deck` globally and run `spacemacs-anki-deck some-folder`
- use `npx` with `npx spacemacs-anki-deck some-folder`
- using source: run `npm start` from source folder, and provide some folder to generate

Cards definitions are in the [mappings folder](./mappings)

A first deck is available in the [release section](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/spacemacs-anki-deck/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

**Please note**: I'm not really using spacemacs that right now, having changed editor. But feel free to open a PR to update bindings if you ned
