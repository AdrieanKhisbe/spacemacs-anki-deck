# Spacemacs Anki Deck

Basic [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org) [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) deck generator.


Generate the `apkg` deck with the following commands:
```sh
  node index.js
```

Cards definitions are in the [bindings folder](./bindings)

A first deck is available in the [release section](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/spacemacs-anki-deck/releases/tag/v0.1.0).


**Please note**: I'm not really using spacemacs that right now, having changed editor. But feel free to open a PR to update bindings if you ned
